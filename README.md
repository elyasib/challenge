## Data challenge

# Running the code
To run the code you should have sbt installed. In Mac:

`brew install sbt`

Then enter the sbt console:

`sbt`

And run the code:

`run {absolute-path-to-data-file}`

Alternatively you can test the code using the dataset you (wizeline) provided by executing:

`sbt test`

or if you are already at the sbt console, just

`test`
